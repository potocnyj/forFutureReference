title: "A Higher Standard for Filing Issues"

Last Friday, a couple of my colleagues were cleaning up old issues in Github, and
I decided to go through the issues I had filed and close out all of the ones that
I didn't think made sense to keep. I started with 178 open issues authored by me;
at the end I had only 12.

Of the issues I closed, some were outdated, no longer relevant, or superseded by
other planned work. There were a lot though that I simply didn't think were important
anymore. They detailed things like potential improvements or cleanups in our codebase, and
even though they were valid I honestly couldn't justify why we'd want to divert
time to work on them.

As an example - one issue suggested refactoring an internal service to make it easier
to maintain. That might be a good idea, but we don't have any plans to change it soon,
so if we  did it wouldn't provide any benefits. If things change and I end up working
on that service I'd probably make some improvements to the structure on my own anyway,
so in the end the issue was just adding noise.

Going forward I want to try operating with a higher standard for filing new issues.
If I don't think something is immediately actionable and has a clear benefit, then
I'm not filing an issue for it. My hope is that being more selective about what
I file issues for will help the company be more focused. After all, we can't work
on everything, and a huge backlog of potential work makes it harder to find the
truly important tasks to prioritize.
